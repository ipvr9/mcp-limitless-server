# Limitless MCP Server (v0.1.0)
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.1.0-blue) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that connects your Limitless Pendant data to AI tools like Claude, Windsurf, and others via the [Limitless API](https://limitless.ai/developers). It lets AI chat interfaces and agents interact with your Lifelog in a structured, programmable way. Let‚Äôs build towards a more organized, intelligent future‚Äîone context-rich interaction at a time.

> **What‚Äôs MCP?**  
> [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open standard for connecting AI models to external tools and data‚Äîthink of it like the USB-C port or even the HTTP protocol for AI‚Äîuniversal, reliable, and designed for extensibility. The standard that everyone adopts. It enables rich integrations, custom workflows, and seamless communication between AI and the tools you use every day.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** As of March 2025, the Limitless API **requires data recorded via the Limitless Pendant**. This server depends on real data recorded from your Limitless Pendant‚Äîit won‚Äôt return anything meaningful without it. Ensure your Pendant is connected and recording.

**API Status & Future Plans:**
*   The official Limitless API is currently in **beta**. As such, it may occasionally be unreliable, subject to change, or experience temporary outages.
*   Requesting large amounts of data (e.g., listing or searching hundreds of logs) may sometimes result in **timeout errors (like 504 Gateway Time-out)** due to API or network constraints. The server includes a 120-second timeout per API call to mitigate this, but very large requests might still fail.
*   The Limitless API is under **active development**. This MCP server will be updated with new features and improvements as they become available in the official API.
*   **Version 0.2.0** of this MCP server is already under development, with plans to add more robust features and potentially new tools in the near future!

## Features (v0.1.0)

*   **List/Get Lifelogs:** Retrieve Pendant recordings by ID, date, date range, or list recent entries. Includes control over sort direction (`asc`/`desc`).
*   **Search Recent Logs:** Perform simple text searches within the content of a configurable number of recent Pendant recordings (Note: only recent logs are searchable; full-history search is not supported).

> With this server, you can do things like pull action items from your Lifelog and send them directly into Notion‚Äîvia Claude, ChatWise, Windsurf, or any other AI assistant/app that supports MCP.

## Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later required)
*   npm or yarn
*   A Limitless account and API key ([Get one here](https://limitless.ai/developers))
*   **A Limitless Pendant (Required for data)**
*   An MCP Client application (e.g., Claude, Windsurf, Cursor, ChatWise, ChatGPT (coming soon!)) capable of spawning stdio servers and passing environment variables.

## Setup

1.  **Clone or download this project.**
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd mcp-limitless-server
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Build the code:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

## Configuration (Client-Side)

This server expects the `LIMITLESS_API_KEY` to be provided as an **environment variable** when it is launched by your MCP client.

You need to add a server configuration block to your MCP client's settings file. Below are two examples depending on whether you are adding this as your first server or adding it alongside existing servers.

**Example A: Adding as the first/only server**

If your client's configuration file currently has an empty `mcpServers` object (`"mcpServers": {}`), replace it with this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "limitless": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["<FULL_FILE_PATH_TO_DIST_SERVER.js>"],
      "env": {
        "LIMITLESS_API_KEY": "<YOUR_LIMITLESS_API_KEY_HERE>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Example B: Adding to existing servers**

If your `mcpServers` object already contains other servers (like `"notion": {...}`), add the `"limitless"` block alongside them, ensuring correct JSON syntax (commas between entries):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "some_other_server": {
      "command": "...",
      "args": ["..."],
      "env": {
        "EXAMPLE_VAR": "value"
      }
    },
    "limitless": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["<FULL_FILE_PATH_TO_DIST_SERVER.js>"],
      "env": {
        "LIMITLESS_API_KEY": "<YOUR_LIMITLESS_API_KEY_HERE>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:**
*   Replace `<FULL_FILE_PATH_TO_DIST_SERVER.js>` with the correct, **absolute path** to the built server script (e.g., `/Users/yourname/Documents/MCP/mcp-limitless-server/dist/server.js`). Relative paths might not work reliably depending on the client.
*   Replace `<YOUR_LIMITLESS_API_KEY_HERE>` with your actual Limitless API key.
*   MCP config files **cannot contain comments**. Remove any placeholder text like `<YOUR_LIMITLESS_API_KEY_HERE>` and replace it with your actual key.

## Running the Server (via Client)

**Do not run `npm start` directly.**

1.  Ensure the server is built successfully (`npm run build`).
2.  Configure your MCP client as shown above.
3.  Start your MCP client application. It will launch the `mcp-limitless-server` process automatically when needed.

## Exposed MCP Tools (v0.1.0)

(Refer to [`src/server.ts`](./src/server.ts) or ask the server via your client for full details.)

1.  **`limitless_get_lifelog_by_id`**: Retrieves a single Pendant recording by its specific ID.
2.  **`limitless_list_lifelogs_by_date`**: Lists Pendant recordings for a specific date.
3.  **`limitless_list_lifelogs_by_range`**: Lists Pendant recordings within a date/time range.
4.  **`limitless_list_recent_lifelogs`**: Lists the most recent Pendant recordings.
5.  **`limitless_search_lifelogs`**: Searches title/content of *recent* Pendant recordings (limited scope!).

## Notes & Limitations

üö´ **Pendant Required**  
This server depends on data generated by the Limitless Pendant.

üß™ **API Beta Status**  
The Limitless API is in beta and may experience occasional instability or rate limiting. Large requests might result in timeouts (e.g., 504 errors).

üîç **Search Scope**  
`limitless_search_lifelogs` only scans a limited number of recent logs (default 20, max 100). It does *not* search your full history ‚Äî use listing tools first for broader analysis.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Error Handling & Timeout**  
API errors are translated into MCP error results. Each API call has a 120-second timeout.

üîå **Transport**  
This server uses `stdio` and is meant to be launched by an MCP-compatible client app.
